Assignment 2: Jacobians, Trajectory Planning and Robot Programming

JACOBIANS
1) With the Jacobian of a manipulator we can compute speeds in the Cartesian speeds out of
speeds in the joint space. Explain what is the difference between ଴ ܬand ௡ ܬof a manipulator, when
they are used to compute the Cartesian speeds out of the joints speeds
2) How do you convert ௡ ܬto ଴ .ܬWhy is it important to make computations respect to frame {0}?

TRAJECTORY PLANNING
Your task is to plan a welding profile done by a robot. The robot that performs this operation has a welding torch attached to its last link.
